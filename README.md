# Twins-MinneAnalytics

This is a portfolio of my team's work to being the first high school team to enter and place second in the Midwest Undergraduate Data Analytics Competition. The MinneMUDAC 2023 Challenge was centered on America’s National Pastime – Baseball!  We gained an understanding of how various factors influence attendance at Major League Baseball (MLB) games. This is the publishing of our public code and not our proprietary modeling or data we used to consult the Twins.

MinneMUDAC 2023 teamed up with the MN Twins for the challenge.  The Minnesota Twins / MLB were our clients for the challenge.  We presented our outcomes/findings in-person at Target Field.

Our Goals:
- Understand and analyze the distribution of home-game attendance for the MN Twins and other MLB teams 
- Identify factors that tend to influence home-game attendance for the MN Twins
- How do the important factors that tend to influence home-game attendance differ between the MN Twins and other MLB teams?
- Provide insights into how the important factors identified above could be used by the MN Twins (or other MLB organizations) to better inform marketing strategies, staffing strategies, supply chain strategies, fan experience, etc. 
- Predict the game-by-game attendance all 2023 MN Twins home games

Additional Considerations:

Disruptions (e.g. COVID, 9/11 tragedy, etc) have occurred over time that have adversely affected attendance.  Attendance for games affected by such tragedies were removed from consideration for the challenge.

Games may be postponed (or canceled) for various reasons.  Postponed games are sometimes rescheduled as double-headers.  Attendance outcomes for double-headers are not recorded in a consistent manner. Thus, all games that are identified by MLB as being postponed were excluded from consideration in the quality of prediction metrics.

MLB baseball has a small number of games being played at atypical locations (Estadio Alfredo Harp Helu, London Stadium, and Muncy Bank Ballpark). These games were excluded from consideration in the quality of prediction metrics.
